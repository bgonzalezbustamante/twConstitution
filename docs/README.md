This is a Twitter online tracker of the Chilean referendum for a new Constitution in October 2020, which contains daily datasets on **#Apruebo** (see words network, *forthcoming*) and **#Rechazo** (see words network, *forthcoming*) viewpoints on this social media. 

> **These data sets are currently being used in this [research project](https://training-datalab.com/projects/vip-project-machine-learning).**

Data sets are scraped and uploaded regularly. Some of the variables are date, hour, username, tweet text, RT count, fav count, location, among others. The data was collected during the afternoon each day. A couple of exceptions, such as October 6th and 26th, were collected early morning on the following day. This is not an issue because the data could be sliced, and in order to work with the whole period, it is necessary to merge the sets and retain unique cases.

> Following current ethical considerations on social media research, the files in UTF-8 encoded comma-delimited values format have been temporarily moved to a secured and private repository to protect users-specific information and geolocated data. Once that kind of information will be anonymised with a cryptographic algorithm based on a hash function, the data will be re-released.
